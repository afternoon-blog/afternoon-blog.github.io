译自唐恬的《如愿》
<br>
<br>你是遥遥的路
<br>山野大雾里的灯
<br>You are the distant road
<br>The beacon in the mountain fog
<br>
<br>我是孩童啊 
<br>走在你的眼眸
<br>I am but a child
<br>Wandering within your gaze
<br>
<br>你是明月清风
<br>我是你照拂的梦
<br>You are the bright moon, the gentle breeze
<br>I am the dream you shelter
<br>
<br>见与不见都一生与你相拥
<br>而我将爱你所爱的人间
<br>愿你所愿的笑颜
<br>你的手我蹒跚在牵
<br>请带我去明天
<br>Whether we meet or not, I will embrace you for a lifetime
<br>And I will love the world you love
<br>Wish for the smiles you wish for
<br>I stumble as I clutch your hand
<br>Please lead me to tomorrow
<br>
<br>如果说你曾苦过我的甜
<br>我愿活成你的愿
<br>If you ever endured bitterness for my sweetness
<br>I am willing to live out your wishes
<br>
<br>愿不枉啊 愿勇往啊
<br>这盛世每一天
<br>May it not be in vain, may we bravely move forward
<br>In this prosperous world every day
<br>
<br>你是岁月长河
<br>星火燃起的天空
<br>You are the river of time
<br>The sky ignited by starlight
<br>
<br>我是仰望者 
<br>就把你唱成歌
<br>I am your admirer
<br>Singing you into my song
<br>
<br>你是我之所来
<br>也是我心之所归
<br>You are where I began
<br>And where my heart will rest
<br>
<br>世间所有路都将与你相逢
<br>而我将爱你所爱的人间
<br>愿你所愿的笑颜
<br>你的手我蹒跚在牵
<br>请带我去明天
<br>All roads in this world will lead to you
<br>And I will love the world you love
<br>Wish for the smiles you wish for
<br>I stumble as I clutch your hand
<br>Please lead me to tomorrow
<br>
<br>如果说你曾苦过我的甜
<br>我愿活成你的愿
<br>愿不枉啊 愿勇往啊
<br>这盛世每一天
<br>If you ever endured bitterness for my sweetness
<br>I am willing to live out your wishes
<br>May it not be in vain, may we bravely move forward
<br>In this prosperous world every day
<br>
<br>山河无恙 烟火寻常
<br>可是你如愿的眺望
<br>孩子们啊 安睡梦乡
<br>像你深爱的那样
<br>Your land at peace, your folks at ease
<br>Is this not the vision you yearned for?
<br>Children sleep soundly in their dreams
<br>Just like the way you love so deeply
<br>
<br>而我将梦你所梦的团圆
<br>愿你所愿的永远
<br>走你所走的长路
<br>这样的爱你啊
<br>And I will dream of the reunions you dream of
<br>Wish for the forever you wish for
<br>Walk the long roads you walk
<br>To love you like this
<br>
<br>我也将见你未见的世界
<br>写你未写的诗篇
<br>天边的月 心中的念
<br>你永在我身边
<br>I will see the world you haven't seen
<br>Write the poems you haven't written
<br>The moon at the horizon, the thoughts in my heart
<br>You are always by my side
<br>
<br>与你相约 一生清澈
<br>如你年轻的脸
<br>With you, I make a promise, a lifetime of innocence
<br>Just like your youthful face
<br>
<br>


配乐朗诵
